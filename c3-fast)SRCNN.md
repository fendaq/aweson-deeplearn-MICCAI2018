## Accelerating the Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network(2016)

the Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network(SRCNN) has demonstrated superior performance to the previous
hand-crafted models either in speed and restoration quality.

### Re-design 
(1) deconv

(2) reformulate the mapping laye

(3) smaller filter sizes, more mapping layers

### Dataset
91-imag dataset, BSD500 dataset, General-100 dataset(bmp-format)
