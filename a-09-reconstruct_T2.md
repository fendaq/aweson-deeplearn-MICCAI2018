## Ultra-Fast T2-Weighted MR Reconstruction Using Complementary T1-Weighted Information

### Challenge
The total acquisition time of ~10 min yields the image quality vunerable to artifacts such as motion

### Task
speed up the reconstruction
```
                        reconstruct
          
T1 + under-sampled T2 --------------> fully-sampled T2    
```
