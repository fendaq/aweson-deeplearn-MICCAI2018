## Adversarial Sparse-View CBCT Artifact Reduction

cone-beam CT(CBCT) images

image-to-image generative models, a perceptual loss, discriminator, feature pyramid networks(FPN)

### Task
correct the cone-beam artifacts from clinical CBCT images reconstructed using 1/3 projections

No scheme has been proposed to correct the cone-beam artifacts introduced by sparse-view CBCT reconstruction in a
post processing step

Many works leverage deep neural netowrks(DNNs) for low-dose CT(LDCT) denoising.
