## [Generative Invertible Networks (GIN): Pathophysiology-Interpretable Feature Mapping and Virtual Patient Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.04495.pdf)


### Challenge
(1) lack data

(2) unbalanced prediction input and output

### Methods
1. data augmentation

  - (X) most image augmentation methods in natural images may impose alterations with pathophysiologic significance to medical
images

2. transfer learning 

  - (X) not accurate

3. generate virtual patients
