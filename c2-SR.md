## Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks(2015)

Super-resolution(SR) is an underdetermined inverse problem, solution is not unique.

Sparse-coding-based method, representative external example-based SR methods

### Contributions
(1) end-to-end mapping, little pre/post-processing beyond the optimization

(2) relation between CNN and sparse-coding-based SR methods

### Dataset
ILSVRC2013 ImageNet detection training partition
