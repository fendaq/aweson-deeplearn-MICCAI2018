## Multi-channel Generative Adversarial Network for Parallel Magnetic Resonance Image Reconstruction in K-space

### Challenge
the Nyquist sampling rate(MRI), imaging acceleartion

multi-channel GAN matches the parallel data acquistion system architecture, originall-collected multi-channel complex data.

### Clinical standards
GRAPPA, SENSE

\[8] a data-driven scheme based on generative adversarial network(GAN), combined with compressed sensing

MRI phisically collects multi-channel complex data samples in Fourier space(termed k-space in the field of MRI)

### Features
(1) input : multi-channel complex undersampled MRI data; output : multi-channel complex fully-sampled MRI data

(2) end-to-end, MRI reconstruction
