## Efficient and Accurate MRI Super-Resolution using a Generative Adversarial Network and 3D Multi-Level Densely Connected Network

### Challenge
due to hardware and physics limitations, high-resolution(HR) imaging comes at the cost of long scan time,
low signal to noise. SR is a challenging problem, because of its underdetermined nature.

### Dataset
the human connectome project

### Techniques
DenseNet, Wasserstein GAN(WGAN)

a 3D Multi-level Densely Connected Super-Resolution Networks(mDCSRN)

### Remaining
\[4] Efficient and Accurate MRI Super-Resolution using a
Generative Adversarial Network and 3D Multi-Level
Densely Connected Network

\[5] Accelerating the super-resolution convolutional
neural network
